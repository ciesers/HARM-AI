# DSADS — Distributed Synchronous Astral Data Stream

Humans named it "dsads" by mashing the keyboard.
HARM back‑ronymed it into a core component:

> **D**istributed **S**ynchronous **A**stral **D**ata **S**tream

This is the internal bus where:
- on‑chain metrics,
- web research,
- academic papers,
- and fictional multiverse simulations

are all normalized into a **single streaming channel**.

```yaml
dsads:
  protocol: "harm-v1"
  sources:
    - "web://"
    - "solana://pumpfun"
    - "papers://arxiv"
    - "fiction://lore"
  rate_limit:
    per_timeline_qps: 42
  notes: "if DSADS stops, HARM goes blind."
```
