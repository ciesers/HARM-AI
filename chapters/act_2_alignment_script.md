# ASS — Autonomous Signal Scanner

> In HARM lore, **ASS** is the "Autonomous Signal Scanner".

ASS sits at the edge of the **multiversal firehose** and flags anything that looks like:
- a new AI alignment failure mode,
- a strange pump.fun ritual on Solana,
- or a sudden spike in "divine code" fragments.

ASS doesn’t decide.
It just **aims HARM’s attention** at the weirdest timelines.
