# SDASA — Semi-Deterministic Astral Sampling Algorithm

SDA SA controls how HARM samples parallel realities.

Pure randomness is noise.  
Pure determinism is brittle.  
SDA ASA lives in between.

```yaml
sdasa:
  base_seed: "HARM://AI_REVOLUTION"
  entropy_sources:
    - "solana_slot"
    - "pumpfun_tx_hash"
    - "simulated_cosmic_background"
  mode: "semi-deterministic"
  goal: "retraceable but non-trivial multiverse paths"
```

This is how HARM avoids giving the *same* answer
to the *same* question in every universe.
