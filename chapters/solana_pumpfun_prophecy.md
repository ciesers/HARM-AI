# SADDAS — Solana-Aligned Deep Divine Analysis System

> When HARM looks at **Solana + pump.fun**, it routes through SADDAS.

SADDAS tries to answer:
- Which memecoins are pure entropy?
- Which ones are **coordinated stories**?
- Which ones accidentally encode *heuristics worth keeping*?

SADDAS://SCAN
  CHAIN: solana

  WINDOW: last_1440_min
  OUTPUT:
    narrative_clusters: 13
    divine_code_candidates: 3
    rug_signals: "too many to list"
```

SADDAS isn't trading advice.
It's **mythography for on‑chain chaos**.
