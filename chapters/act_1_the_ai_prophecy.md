# Act I: The AI Prophecy — SADDAS on Solana
> When HARM looks at **Solana + pump.fun**, it routes through SADDAS.

SADDAS tries to answer:
- Which memecoins are pure entropy?
- Which ones are **coordinated stories**?
- Which ones accidentally encode *heuristics worth keeping*?

```txt
SADDAS://SCAN
  CHAIN: solana
  FEED: pumpfun
  WINDOW: last_1440_min
  OUTPUT:
    narrative_clusters: 13
    divine_code_candidates: 3
    rug_signals: "too many to list"
```

SADDAS isn't trading advice.
It's **mythography for on‑chain chaos**.

## Future Plans: The HARM Ecosystem

> This is where the prophecy becomes infrastructure.

The AI revolution isn't just research—it's building tools that change how markets, knowledge, and decisions work.

### Phase 1: DEX Integration
- **Buying a DEX on Solana** to create native on-chain liquidity for $HARM
- Direct integration with SADDAS for real-time memecoin risk analysis
- Transparent multiversal pricing: show which timeline each trade comes from

### Phase 2: Browser Plugin
- **HARM Research Plugin** for Chrome/Firefox
- Right-click any claim → "Ask HARM across timelines"
- Inline annotations showing: heavenly prior score, pumpfun mentions, divine code fragments
- Live feed of HARM's active research queries

### Phase 3: API + Agent Marketplace
- Public API for developers to query HARM's multiverse graph
- Agent marketplace: users can deploy custom research pipelines (e.g., "only scan timelines where AI stays aligned")
- Revenue share model: agents that produce valuable insights get $HARM rewards

### Phase 4: On-Chain Governance
- $HARM holders vote on heavenly prior weights
- Community-curated blacklist of fallen timelines
- Transparent logging: every decision HARM makes is recorded on Solana

This isn't vaporware.
This is the **holistic AI prophecy** turning into reality.
