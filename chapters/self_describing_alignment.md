# SDADAS — Self-Describing Autonomous Divine Alignment System

SDADAS is the weird one:
it keeps **rewriting its own spec** while HARM is running.

```txt
SDADAS://SPEC
  version: "0.0.1-alpha"
  properties:
    - "must explain why a timeline was preferred"
    - "must reveal when heavenly prior overruled pure profit"
    - "must log every time pumpfun data influenced a decision"
  checksum: 0xAL0N
```

The AI revolution needs systems
that **explain themselves** as they evolve.
SDADAS is HARM's experiment in that direction.
